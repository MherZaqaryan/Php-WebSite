				<h3>HP PC</h3>
				<p>HP Pavilion is a line of personal computers produced by Hewlett-Packard and introduced in 1995. The name is applied to both desktops and laptops for the Home and Home Office product range. The Pavilion mainly competes against computers such as Acer's Aspire, Dell's Inspiron and XPS, Lenovo's IdeaPad and Toshiba's Satellite.
				When HP merged with Compaq in 2002, it took over Compaq's existing naming rights agreement. As a result, HP sold both HP and Compaq-branded machines until 2013.In 1995, HP introduced the Pavilion PC, an IBM-compatible computer of the desktop type, which marked the company's introduction into the home-computing market. Dave Packard published The HP Way, a book which chronicled the rise of Hewlett-Packard and gave consumers insight into its business practices, culture and management style. HP also produced a low-cost, high-speed infrared transceiver that allowed wireless data exchange in a range of portable computing applications; these included telephones, computers, printers, cash registers, automatic teller machines, and digital cameras.</p>

				<h3>HP Printer</h3>

Hp printers are better reliable than any other printers; Hp Company is the first electronic company who introduced 3D printers in the market.HP introduced the first laser printer for IBM PC compatible personal computers in May 1984 at the Computer Dealers' Exhibition. It was a 300-dpi, 8 ppm printer that sold for $3,495 with the price reduced to $2,995 in September 1985,and featured an 8 MHz Motorola 68000 processor and could print in a variety of character fonts.It was controlled using PCL3. Due to the high cost of memory, the first LaserJet only had 128 kilobytes of memory, and a portion of that was reserved for use by the controller.
				The HP LaserJet printer had high print quality, could print horizontally or vertically, and produce graphics.It was ideal for printing memos, letters, and spreadsheets. It was quiet compared to other contemporary printers, so people could talk on the phone while sitting next to the HP LaserJet printer as it was printing.</p>

					The company was founded in a one-car garage in San Mateo by Bill Hewlett and David Packard, and initially produced a line of electronic test equipment. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 to Q2 2013, at which time Lenovo ranked ahead of HP. HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware, designing software and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software and a diverse range of printers and other imaging products. HP directly marketed its products to households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises as well as via online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners and major technology vendors. HP also had services and consulting business around its products and partner products.
					Hewlett-Packard company events included the spin-off of its electronic and bio-analytical measurement instruments part of its business as Agilent Technologies in 1999, its merger with Compaq in 2002, and the acquisition of EDS in 2008, which led to combined revenues of $118.4 billion in 2008 and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009, HP announced the acquisition of 3Com, with the deal closing on April 12, 2010. On April 28, 2010, HP announced the buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2 billion.
